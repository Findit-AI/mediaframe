//! # Feature tiers
//!
//! The crate builds at three tiers, and the tier decides how *open*
//! its vocabularies are.
//!
//! | Tier | Features | Vocabularies |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | no-alloc | (none) | **closed** — an unrecognised slug is rejected |
//! | alloc | `alloc` | open — an unrecognised slug rides `Other(SmolStr)` |
//! | std | `std` (implies `alloc`) | as `alloc`, plus `std::error::Error` |
//!
//! `Other(SmolStr)` needs a heap, so it exists only at the `alloc` /
//! `std` tier. At the no-alloc tier the same enums are closed and their
//! [`FromStr`](core::str::FromStr) returns the vocabulary's own error
//! instead: **an error beats a wrong value**, and collapsing an unknown
//! name onto a named variant would be a wrong value. The *wire shape* is
//! the same at every tier (a slug either way) — only the openness
//! differs.
//!
//! Since 0.5.0 the **error type follows the tier too**. Where the escape
//! arm exists the parse cannot fail, so `FromStr::Err` is
//! [`Infallible`](core::convert::Infallible) and a caller can discharge it
//! with an irrefutable `let Ok(x) = s.parse::<T>();`. The vocabulary's own
//! `Parse*Error` stays exported and is still what the no-alloc tier
//! returns. This applies to the vocabularies compiled at *every* tier —
//! the colour enums, [`PixelFormat`](pixel_format::PixelFormat), and the
//! frame orientation enums. Vocabularies that only exist at the `alloc`
//! tier have had `Err = Infallible` all along.
//!
//! Every gate on an alloc-tier item is spelled
//! `any(feature = "std", feature = "alloc")` rather than bare
//! `feature = "alloc"`, so the item cannot evaporate for a dependant
//! that turns on `std` alone.

/// Gated on exactly the features that own a row door, because the text

/// plus `source::pal8` (`mono`), `source::xyz12` (`xyz`) and
/// `frame::bayer` (`bayer`). Without the gate the lean build defines a
/// macro nothing expands, which `unused_macros` rejects.
///
/// All fifteen format features are on the list, which is a fact about
/// today's doors and not a synonym for "every format": it is written
/// out feature by feature so a format that loses its last door leaves
/// the list and the gate stays honest. The umbrella `frame` feature
/// cannot stand in for the disjunction either — it implies the format
/// features, not the reverse, so `--features rgb` alone would leave the
/// macro undefined at an expansion site.

      [`Self::new`] is `pub(crate)`. Production rows come from the walkers,\n\
      which read the colour selector off the sink, so on the public surface\n\
      a row cannot be conjured beside the description that chose it. This\n\
      door is the one named exception to that.\n\
      \n\
      It exists because a kernel-parity suite drives a single row kernel\n\
      without materialising a frame, and there is no other way to reach one\n\
      from outside this crate. Not hypothetical: a census on 2026-08-19\n\
      found **493 such constructions across 85 files and 52 row types** in\n\
      `pixon` alone, every one of them test code.\n\
      \n\
      Takes exactly what `new` takes, colour selector included, so the two\n\
      cannot drift. **No stability promise** — it is `#[doc(hidden)]` and\n\
      may change or vanish in any release. If you are not testing a row\n\

/// Declares a vocabulary's `ROSTER` **and** the compile-time witness that
/// keeps it complete, from one list of variant names.
///
/// The list is written once. From it the macro emits:
///
/// 1. `pub const ROSTER: &'static [Self]` — the named variants in
///    declaration order, as a **slice** so the count stays out of the
///    type and growing the vocabulary remains a minor change; and
/// 2. an exhaustive `match` beside the type. `#[non_exhaustive]` does not
///    bind the defining crate, so that `match` really is exhaustive here:
///    a new variant makes it `E0004` and the compiler names the variant
///    that was added. Updating this one list fixes both artefacts at
///    once, which is why they are not two lists that can drift.

/// because the two families gate it differently: vocabularies living in
/// `alloc`-only modules carry `Other` unconditionally (`escape:`), while
/// those compiled at every tier carry it behind

/// escape is deliberately **not** a roster member — the roster is the set
/// of names this build knows, and the escape is the arm holding a name it
