/// and `Ogg` (`"ogv"`). A handful of variants also have genuine
/// alternate on-disk spellings (`.qt`, `.ogx`, `.mpg4`, `.3gpp`) —
/// [`Self::extensions`] lists every one, canonical first, and

/// / `Threegp.extensions()`; both landings failed this crate's own
/// identical-bytes test for an alias (Codex R5), because both name a
/// structurally different container from the one they were attached to
/// — see [`Self::M2ts`] and [`Self::Threeg2`]'s own docs for the byte
/// -level distinction each carries.
///
/// **Variant naming note:** the `.3gp` / `.3g2` containers' variants are
/// named [`Self::Threegp`] / [`Self::Threeg2`] — Rust identifiers cannot
/// start with a digit, and `_3gp` would render as `"3gp"` under
/// `derive_more::Display`'s snake-casing but is unidiomatic. The
/// `as_str()` / `FromStr` surface still returns / matches the canonical
/// `"3gp"` / `"3g2"` slugs. `M2ts` mirrors `MpegTs`'s own capitalisation
/// convention (a digit mid-identifier gets no case break on either
/// side: `M2ts`, not `M2Ts` or `M2TS`).
