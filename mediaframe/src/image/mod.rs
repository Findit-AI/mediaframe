//! Still-image vocabulary — standard photo formats plus the camera-RAW
//! family.
//!
//! mediaframe's other vocabularies cover video / audio / subtitle
//! streams; before this module no still-image formats existed anywhere
//! in the crate, so a consumer filtering by [`crate::container::Format`]
//! and [`crate::audio::ContainerFormat`] (the two container rosters) had
//! no way to recognise a photograph. This household is the fix — a flat
//! top-level module, the same shape as [`crate::container`] and
//! [`crate::audio`], not nested under either.
//!
//! # The RAW roster is a curated cut, not ExifTool's full list
//!
//! ExifTool recognises several dozen camera-RAW extensions (one or more
//! per manufacturer generation). [`Format`]'s RAW variants are a
//! deliberately curated subset — current or historically substantial
//! single-vendor formats — with the long tail left to the
//! [`Format::Other`] escape. Named:
//!
//! - **Adobe DNG** ([`Format::Dng`]) — the open, cross-vendor standard.
//! - **Canon** — [`Format::Cr2`], [`Format::Cr3`].
//! - **Nikon** — [`Format::Nef`], [`Format::Nrw`] (the compact-camera
//!   second extension).
//! - **Sony** — [`Format::Arw`].
//! - **Olympus / OM System** — [`Format::Orf`] (the `.ori` spelling is
//!   an extension alias, not a second format — see [`Format::extensions`]).
//! - **Panasonic** — [`Format::Rw2`].
//! - **Fujifilm** — [`Format::Raf`].
//! - **Pentax** — [`Format::Pef`].
//! - **Samsung** — [`Format::Srw`].
//! - **Leica** — [`Format::Rwl`].
//! - **Phase One** — [`Format::Iiq`] (professional medium format).
//! - **Hasselblad** — [`Format::Threefr`] (`.3fr`; see the variant's own
//!   doc for the digit-leading-name note).
//! - **Sigma** — [`Format::X3f`] (Foveon sensor).
//! - **Minolta** — [`Format::Mrw`] (legacy, but real archival volume and
//!   the direct lineage ancestor of Sony's Alpha mount / [`Format::Arw`]).
//! - **GoPro** — [`Format::Gpr`] (DNG-based; current product).
//!
//! **Deliberately excluded** (ride [`Format::Other`] if ever met), with
//! reasons: `CRW` (Canon's pre-CR2 format, superseded); `ARQ` (Sony's
//! *derived* pixel-shift composite, not a sensor read-out); `SR2`/`SRF`
//! (Sony's older predecessors to `ARW`); `DCR`/`KDC` (Kodak — exited the
//! camera business); `MEF` (Mamiya, very low volume); `FFF`/`MOS`
//! (Hasselblad/Leaf legacy backs, very low volume); `CS1` (Sinar,
//! ultra-niche studio product); `K25` (1990s point-and-shoot antique);
//! `LRI` (Light Co., a discontinued product from a defunct company);
//! the bare `RAW` extension (ExifTool itself resolves it ambiguously —
//! Kyocera Contax N Digital *or* Panasonic — and the string would
//! collide with this doc's own "RAW family" heading); and the
//! space-containing `"Canon 1D RAW"` legacy special-case (not a real
//! filename extension). Two more are excluded for a different reason —
//! wrong domain, not low volume: `CRM` ("Canon RAW **Movie**") and
//! `R3D` (RedCode — cinema-camera video) are motion formats despite the
//! "RAW" name, not stills; `CZI` (Zeiss) is microscopy, not photography.
//!
//! # ffmpeg census
//!
//! ffmpeg (n9.0, this repo's pinned tag family) demuxes standard stills
//! through the generic `image2` / `*_pipe` family (`jpeg_pipe`,
//! `png_pipe`, `tiff_pipe`, `webp_pipe`, `gif_pipe`, `bmp_pipe`, …) —
//! there is no dedicated per-format demuxer the way `mov`/`mkv`/`webm`
//! each get one. HEIF/HEIC/AVIF are **not** in that pipe family at all:
//! they are ISOBMFF-boxed, so ffmpeg reads them through the shared
//! `mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2` demuxer — the exact demuxer
//! [`crate::container::Format::Mov`] / [`crate::container::Format::Mp4`]
//! already name. This mirrors ExifTool's own table, where `CR3`
//! (`crate::image::Format::Cr3`) *also* resolves to base type `MOV` —
//! camera-RAW and modern still-image formats routinely ride a
//! video-container byte format while remaining, functionally, a single
//! still image. `Format` names them by their *content* (a photograph),
//! not by which demuxer happens to open the bytes; findit's walk keeps
//! offering files by extension regardless of which internal container
//! carries them.
//!
//! # ExifTool census (the `exifast` tree, read-only local oracle)
//!
//! `exifast`'s `filetype_data.rs` is a 1:1 port of ExifTool's own
//! `%fileTypeLookup`, including its canonical write-extension choices
//! (`ExifTool.pm:595` picks `"jpg"` for `JPEG`; `ExifTool.pm:598` picks
//! `"tif"` for `TIFF`) and its extension-alias table (`JPG`/`JPE` alias
//! `JPEG`; `TIF` aliases `TIFF`; `ORI` aliases `ORF`). ExifTool's own
//! `HIF` → `HEIF` alias is a static extension-to-FileType *fallback*
//! (`exifast` has not yet ported the brand-level `ftyp` parsing that
//! would let it classify a real file's actual content — `FORMATS.md`
//! marks still-image/RAW modules Stage 2, deferred — so this one entry
//! predates any byte-level check and is not treated as decisive; see
//! [`Format::Heic`]'s own doc for the byte-level evidence that overrides
//! it). [`Format::as_extension`] and [`Format::extensions`] otherwise
//! follow ExifTool's choices directly.
//!
//! **`Heic` and `Heif` are separate variants (R6), not one collapsed
//! variant.** R3 originally merged `HEIC`/`HEIF`/`HIF` onto one
//! [`Format::Heif`], reasoning ExifTool keeps them as "nearly identical"
//! top-level file types both based on `MOV`. That reasoning didn't
//! apply the module's own identical-bytes test: IANA's `image/heic` and
//! `image/heif` registrations gate the two subtypes on **mutually
//! exclusive required ISOBMFF brands** — `heif` requires the generic
//! `mif1` brand (any coding format); `heic` requires one of
//! `heic`/`heix`/`heim`/`heis` (HEVC-coded specifically) — a
//! structurally-signaled subtype distinction, the same shape as the
//! `Avif` vs `Heif` split this module already drew for exactly this
//! reason. See [`Format::Heic`]'s own doc for the full citation, and for
//! why `.hif` is excluded from both variants rather than routed to
//! either (R8).
