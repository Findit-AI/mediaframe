/// Read from container metadata (e.g. MKV `BitRateMode` /

/// most legacy and broadcast pipelines emit constant-bit-rate audio
/// unless explicitly told otherwise; this mirrors the conservative
/// default downstream encoders pick when no mode tag is present.
///
/// **Closed** — deliberately *not* `#[non_exhaustive]`. The
/// trichotomy is the whole of the *reporting* domain and has been
/// stable for twenty-five years: a container states that its audio
/// bit rate is fixed, varies freely, or varies around a target, and
/// there is no fourth thing to state. The near misses are not
/// members: CVBR is a shape of [`Self::Vbr`], and CRF / CQP are
/// *encoder* knobs, describing how a file was produced rather than a
/// property the stream reports. A downstream `match` is therefore
/// exhaustive and the compiler proves it handles every mode.
