///
/// Mirrors FFmpeg's `AVChannelOrder`. The stable wire integers are the
/// `repr(u32)` discriminants and match the [`Self::to_u32`] /
/// [`Self::from_u32`] mapping; [`Self::as_str`] / [`FromStr`] are the
/// text form.
///
/// **Closed** — deliberately *not* `#[non_exhaustive]`, and with no
/// `Other(SmolStr)` escape. `AVChannelOrder` is itself a closed
/// taxonomy: every layout FFmpeg can describe is unspecified, native,
/// custom or ambisonic, so there is no vendor space for an escape arm to
/// preserve. A raw discriminant outside the four is a corrupt read, not
/// a value, and [`Self::from_u32`] decodes it to [`Self::Unspecified`];
/// [`Self::try_from_u32`] is the door that refuses it instead.
///
/// This is the *arrangement* axis. What the arrangement adds up to has
/// its own vocabulary — [`ChannelLayout`](crate::audio::ChannelLayout)
/// names layouts (`"5.1"`, `"quad"`, `"22.2"`), and the two travel
