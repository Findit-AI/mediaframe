//! Audio channel layout vocabulary — the common named layouts plus
//! an `Other(SmolStr)` lossless escape for anything outside the
//! closed set.
//!
//! The named variants cover **every** entry in FFmpeg n9.0's
//! `channel_layout_map[]` — all forty — plus the three ambisonic
//! groupings FFmpeg models as a channel *order* rather than a map entry.
//! What still rides [`ChannelLayout::Other`] is what the map does not
//! name at all: custom channel orderings, ambisonic groupings beyond
//! third order, and whatever a later FFmpeg adds. The escape carries the
//! FFmpeg-canonical slug verbatim.
//!
//! Channel abbreviations in the variant docs are FFmpeg's own
//! (`ffmpeg -layouts`): `FL`/`FR` front left/right, `FC` front centre,
//! `LFE` low frequency, `BL`/`BR` back left/right, `BC` back centre,
//! `SL`/`SR` side left/right, `FLC`/`FRC` front left/right-of-centre,
//! `WL`/`WR` wide left/right, `TC` top centre, `TFL`/`TFC`/`TFR` top
//! front left/centre/right, `TBL`/`TBC`/`TBR` top back
//! left/centre/right, `TSL`/`TSR` top side left/right,
//! `BFL`/`BFC`/`BFR` bottom front left/centre/right, `LFE2` second low
//! frequency, `DL`/`DR` downmix left/right.
//!
//! **Two namings, and they do not line up.** A variant's *ident* follows
//! the FFmpeg constant (`Ch5_1Back` ⇒ `AV_CH_LAYOUT_5POINT1_BACK`);
//! its *slug* is the name FFmpeg's `channel_layout_map[]` gives that
//! constant — what `av_channel_layout_describe` prints, and therefore
//! what an FFmpeg-sourced string actually says. The two disagree three
//! ways, each of which has already cost this crate or its neighbours a
//! bug:
//!
//! 1. **The unqualified name went to whichever layout had it first.**
//!    FFmpeg hands plain `"5.0"`, `"5.1"` and `"7.1(wide)"` to the
//!    **back**-speaker layouts and qualifies the side ones `"5.0(side)"`,
//!    `"5.1(side)"`, `"7.1(wide-side)"`, so six arms read crossed
//!    against their idents. For the 5.1.2 family it runs the other way:
//!    `"5.1.2"` is the side layout and the back one is qualified
//!    `"5.1.2(back)"`. There is no rule to derive here — only the map.
//! 2. **`_BACK` in a constant is not `(back)` in a slug.**
//!    `5POINT1POINT4_BACK`, `7POINT1POINT4_BACK` and
//!    `9POINT1POINT4_BACK` are named `"5.1.4"`, `"7.1.4"` and `"9.1.4"`:
//!    there the suffix distinguishes top-*back* height channels, not
//!    surround placement, and FFmpeg never minted an unsuffixed sibling
//!    to qualify against.
//! 3. **Two idents follow the slug instead of the constant.**
//!    `AV_CH_LAYOUT_2_1` and `AV_CH_LAYOUT_2_2` are historical spellings
//!    that describe no arrangement anyone would recognise — and `2_1`
//!    read as an ident collides with the real `2POINT1`. They are
//!    [`ChannelLayout::Ch3_0Back`] and [`ChannelLayout::QuadSide`],
//!    after `"3.0(back)"` and `"quad(side)"`.
//!
//! `channel_layout_slugs_match_ffmpegs_map` transcribes the whole map
//! and pins every arm, because nothing else catches a plausible-looking
//! "correction".
